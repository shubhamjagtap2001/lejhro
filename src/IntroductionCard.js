            </p>
            <p><strong>Get Audience</strong></p>
            <p>Before getting into any tactics, define who your target audience is. Understanding who you are aiming for will help you to create appropriate content and marketing. The questions to ask are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Who do you want to reach?</strong> Define who the ideal customer is.</li>
              <li><strong>What are their interests and needs?</strong> Understand what their pain points and desires are.</li>
              <li><strong>Where do they spend their time online?</strong> When you clearly know who your audience is, you can develop relevant content and marketing messages accordingly.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Laying a Great Foundation</strong></p>
            <p>You need a structured website to capture these visitors and make sure they are not clicking away. Here is a short list of what matters most:</p>
